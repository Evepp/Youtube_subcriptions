The primary objective of this research is to analyze the variable representing the number of videos a channel has produced and the duration of the channel's existence. This variable serves as a proxy for the consistency with which the YouTuber uploads videos throughout the channel's lifetime. The study employs statistical methods to predict the potential subscriber count a YouTube channel may achieve based on this and other relevant factors.
